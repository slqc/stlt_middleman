## About this Tutorial Series

In this series I will show how to apply the information gained in the [Reverse Engineering tutorials](../WinReverseEng/) to do basic windows exploitation. 


## What are the prerequisites?

You need a basic to solid understanding of AMD64 assembly language and C to understand the source code. Your also need to have a general idea how code is executed on a AMD64 computer.
I recommend that you followed my tutorial on reverse engineering or something similar and did some exercises in kernel debugging by yourself.
