## Intro

This site used to be based on dokuwiki which is in my humble opinion one of the most universally useful things anyone could ever put on a webspace. It can be used to create a website, a blog, a CMS or a full blown colloboration suite. It can even be used as a wiki engine. And all of it based around easy to handle .txt files. It only and mayor downside is that it still looks like the internet used to look in 2004. And I wanted my website to look reasonably modern and so I was forced to look for an alternative.
